we want to change one parameter at a time and see what will happens:
Initialized parameters:
size = 16 #number of queens
number_of_first_population = size
N = 50 #N%  of the best fitnesses will be chosen
Mutation_Probability = 50 #every gene have 50% probability to mutate
Cross_Over_Probability = 50


* NUMBER OF THE FIRST POPULATION:
    - number_of_population = 8 (equals to the number of the queens):
        average genarations: 365
        best genarations: 2

    - number_of_population = 32:
        average genarations: 126
        best genarations: 2

    it works randomly.

* CHOOSE BEST "N" PERCENT OF EACH GENERATION:
    - N = 50:
        average genarations: 370
        best genarations: 2
    
    - N = 70:
        average genarations: 8
        best genarations: 2

    it works better when we decreese N.

* MUTATION PROBABILITY:
    - Mutation_Probability = 50
        average genarations: 320
        best genarations: 2
    
    - Mutation_Probability = 25:
        average genarations: 9
        best genarations: 2

    we can see that the mutation is important and we need more of it.

* CROSS OVER PROBABILITY:
    - Cross_Over_Probability = 50
        average genarations: 367
        best genarations: 2
    
    - Cross_Over_Probability = 25:
        average genarations: 12
        best genarations: 2

    we can see that the cross overs are bad for this question.



* I think what really important is mutation in this question. when we only do the mutation we will have the answer in minimum time.
